# 42C Banking API

A set of banking API with security vulnerabilities exposed in its design and implementation. 

## Introduction ##
42C Banking API provides endpoints to simulated services for an online banking experience. A customer can register a new account, then log into their account and access services like make a payment or apply for a new credit card. 

The first phase of this project simulates a customer online banking experience. 

The second phase will add an additional set of API endpoints to simulate an OpenBanking experience, where third party providers may be granted access to a customers banking data. 

If you have any request, please [create an issue](https://github.com/anthony-42crunch/42c-bank/issues/new) and describe what you need.
